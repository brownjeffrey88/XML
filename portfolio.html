               But all is not right in this new Eden. In the long years since the planet was abandoned,
               the work of its architects has borne disastrous fruit. The planet is not waiting for
               them, pristine and unoccupied. New masters have turned it from a refuge into mankind's
               worst nightmare.
               
               Now two civilizations are on a collision course, both testing the boundaries of what
               they will do to survive. As the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, who are the
               true heirs of this new Earth?

               Those are the last words Jason Dessen hears before the masked abductor knocks him
               unconscious. Before he awakes to find himself strapped to a gurney, surrounded by
               strangers in hazmat suits. Before the man he's never met smiles down at him and says,
               'Welcome back.'
               
               In this world he's woken up to, Jason's life is not the one he knows. His wife is
               not his wife. His son was never born. And Jason is not an ordinary college physics
               professor, but a celebrated genius who has achieved something remarkable. Something
               impossible.
               
               Is it this world or the other that's the dream?
               
               And even if the home he remembers is real, how can Jason possibly make it back to
               the family he loves? The answers lie in a journey more wondrous and horrifying than
               anything he could've imagined - one that will force him to confront the darkest parts
               of himself even as he battles a terrifying, seemingly unbeatable foe.

               the world's largest social networking company; by night, she exploits her database

               long-buried secrets, and of a mysterious figure known as Der Fisher: the Fisherman.
               It will bring Abe and Dan face to face with all that they have lost, and with the

               him but bad songs, dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies.

               nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of

            </table><img src="TH.jpg" alt="3 month history"><p>When Ben, a suburban family man, takes a business trip to rural Pennsylvania, he decides
               to spend the afternoon before his dinner meeting on a short hike. Once he sets out
               into the woods behind his hotel, he quickly comes to realize that the path he has
               chosen cannot be given up easily. With no choice but to move forward, Ben finds himself
               falling deeper and deeper into a world of man-eating giants, bizarre demons, and colossal
               insects.
               
               On a quest of epic, life-or-death proportions, Ben finds help comes in some of the
               most unexpected forms, including a profane crustacean and a variety of magical objects,
               tools, and potions. Desperate to return to his family, Ben is determined to track
               down the “Producer,” the creator of the world in which he is being held hostage and
               the only one who can free him from the path.
               
               At once bitingly funny and emotionally absorbing, Magary’s novel is a remarkably unique
               addition to the contemporary fantasy genre, one that draws as easily from the world
               of classic folk tales as it does from video games. In The Hike, Magary takes readers
               on a daring odyssey away from our day-to-day grind and transports them into an enthralling
               world propelled by heart, imagination, and survival.
